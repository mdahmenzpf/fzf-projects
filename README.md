# FZF Projects

Fuzzy find projects and open them in NeoVim.

```bash
bash fzf-projects
```

## Install and Config

Make sure `fzf` is installed and optionally create an alias in your `.zshrc` in order to run this script from anywhere.
The first time the script runs it will ask for a projects root directory and the editor that will be used to open the selected project.

Afterwards the configuration can be changed by running:

```bash
bash fzf-projects -c
```
